# Common Issues
‚Äã		While adding an app on your Firebase Project, cross-check your android application's package name (e.g com.example.application) which you will find on AndroidManifest.xml or, build.gradle (app level) file. If the package name is wrong adding SHA1 or SHA512 won't be helpful.

Follow the Firebase SDK Instructions properly. Add the required lines of code which they are recommending you to add.

Don't forget to add the SHA1 or SHA512 to your project which you can easily generate using the following command using the terminal of Android Studio.
```bash
cd android 
gradlew signingReport
Use the command flutter clean on the terminal before running the application.
```

Following the Firebase SDK Instructions properly will save you lots of time.

# Generate model

# Add app icon  common
```bash
flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons:main

# Build apk

flutter clean && flutter pub get && flutter pub cache repair &&  flutter build apk --target-platform android-arm,android-arm64,android-x64 --split-per-abi --no-shrink
```


# Known issue

# Check the dependencies between the packages
```bash
flutter pub deps
```

# Uninstall the app from mobile
```bash
source ~/.bash_profile
adb uninstall "com.telsa.dtok"
```

# How to setup build apk
https://github.com/marketplace/actions/flutter-action

# Upgrade gradlew
```bash
./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version 7
```

# Ios build
```bash
flutter clean \
        && rm ios/Podfile.lock pubspec.lock \
        && rm -rf ios/Pods ios/Runner.xcworkspace
```



# My setup: VS Code, Flutter

## If you don't have Podfile.lock file and pod update doesn't help, try this:

1. Go to ios/Pods/Local Podspecs directory in your project
2. Check every json file to find highest required ios version. Mine was  "ios": "10.0" in some of them
3. Go back to ios/ directory
4. Open Podfile file
5. Uncomment # platform :ios, '9.0' and replace 9.0 with version from 2. step, for example 10.0.
    - platform :ios, '9.0' > platform :ios, '10.0'
6. Run pod install and the error should be gone


# Upgrade package
```bash
flutter pub upgrade --major-versions
```

# Install SDKMAN
```
curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
```

# Install JDK 11
```
sdk install java  11.0.18-amzn
```
